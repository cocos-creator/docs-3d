# Shadow

In the 3D world, *light* and *shadows* have always been extremely important components. They can enrich the entire environment, good-quality shadows can achieve the effect of false realization, and make the entire world have a three-dimensional feel to it.

Here is an example of a shadow from __Cocos Creator__:

## Turning on shadows

__Cocos Creator__ currently supports two shadow modes, __shadow Map__ and __planer Shadow__ for developers to use.

* It takes three steps to enable a __Planar Shadow__ in __Cococs Creator 3D__:

  1. Select the Scene node on the level manager, you can see the following panel, check the *Enabled* property of *Shadows*.

  2. Choose *Type* as *Planar*

  3. Set *ShadowCastingMode* to *ON* in the model that needs to display shadows.

  > **Note**: __Planar Shadow__ will only be cast on the shadow surface. Adjusting the directional light angle can adjust the shadow projection.

* It takes four steps to enable a __Shadow Map__ in __Cococs Creator 3D__:

  1. Select the Scene node on the level manager, you can see the following panel, check the *Enabled* property of *Shadows*.

  2. Choose *Type* as *ShadowMap*

  3. Set *ShadowCasting* to *ON* in the model that needs to display shadows.

  4. Set *ReceiveShadow* to *ON* in the model that needs to display shadows.

  > **Note**: __ReceiveShadow__ receive the shadow effect. __ShadowCasting__ produces a shadow effect.
