# Publish to ByteDance Mini Games

ByteDance mini-game is developed based on the ByteDance full products, which does not require users to download, and is a brand-new game type that can be played on tap.

The game submission, review and release process of the mini-games need to comply with the requirements and standard processes of the Byte official team. For specific information, please refer to the link at the end of the article.

##  Resource Management for ByteDance Mini Game Environment

In a **ByteDance Mini Game** environment, resource management is the most special part. It differs from the browser in the following four points:

1. The size of the **ByteDance Mini Game** package cannot exceed **4MB**, including all the code and resources. Additional resources must be downloaded via web request.

2. For files downloaded from a remote server, the **ByteDance Mini Game** environment does not have the browser's caching and outdated update mechanism.

3. For the resources in the **ByteDance Mini Game** package, they are not loaded on demand in the mini game environment, but rather all the resources in the package are loaded at once, and then the game page is launched.

4. You cannot download script files from a remote server.

This brings up two key issues, home page loading speed and remote resource caching and version management. For the home page loading speed, we recommend that developers only save the script file in the **ByteDance Mini Game** package, and all other resources are downloaded from the remote server. As for downloading, caching and version management of remote resources, Cocos Creator 3D has done the job for developers.

Specifically, developers need to do:

1. When building, enable the **MD5 Cache** in the **Build** config panel.
2. Set the **Remote service address**, and then click **Build**.
3. When the build is complete, upload the **res** folder in the mini game release package to the server.
4. Delete the **res** folder inside the local release package.
5. For the test phase, you may not be able to deploy to the official server, you need to use the local server to test, then open the details page in the WeChat DevTools, check the `Does not verify valid domain names, web-view (business domain names), TLS versions and HTTPS certificates` option in the **Local Settings**.
