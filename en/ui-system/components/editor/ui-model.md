# UIModel Component Reference

UIModel is a renderer component with a conversion feature that converts 3D models from 3D render pipeline to 2D. This component supports the 3D model and particle display in the UI, without the component, the 3D model and particle nodes will not be rendered even if they are in the UI.

The UIModel component is added by selecting the node with or inherited from the **ModelComponent** in the **Hierarchy** panel, then clicking the **Add Component** button below the **Inspector** panel and selecting **UI/Model**. And the particles are added to the particle nodes. The usual structure is as below:
