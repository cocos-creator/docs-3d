# UIOpacity Component References

The UIOpacity Component records a transparency modification flag for the node, which is used to influence all the render nodes inside its sub tree. Normally it's used on a non render nodes, otherwise its opacity will be multiplied with the render component's opacity. The render nodes can set transparency individually by setting the alpha channel of `color`.

The method of use is as follows

![ui-opacity](uiopacity/ui-opacity.png)

You can also set transparency by code

```ts
    const opacityComp = this.getComponent(UIOpacity);
    opacityComp.opacity = 157;
```

To use the `UIOpacity`, please refer to the [UIOpacity API](https://docs.cocos.com/creator3d/api/en/classes/ui.uiopacity.html) documentation and the [UIOpacity](https://github.com/cocos-creator/test-cases-3d/tree/master/assets/cases/ui/other/opacity) scene of the test-cases-3d project.
