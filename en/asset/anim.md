## Editor Custom Animation
For creatiing custom animations in the __Cocos Creator 3D__ editor, please refer to the [Animation Creation](../editor/animation/animation-create.md) documentation. Information about the [Format](../engine/animation/animation-clip.md#Animationcurve) is also important to understand.

## Bone animations attached after a model import
After a model with animations is imported, the animation on the corresponding model will be generated. This animation is consistent with the use of the newly created internal resources. For cutting a skeletal animation, please refer to [Introduction of Animation Modules for Model Resources](mesh.md) documentation.
